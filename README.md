# FixLagExploit
There's yet another exploit going around the csgo community which allows players to cause the server to stutter. A client has been abusing it in one of the community servers I manage since they are unable to cheat due to a really strong server side anticheat. They resort to any exploit they can to attack the server.

I'm unaware if this is a new feature inside a cheat or if it's completely private still. None the less here's the patch before it becomes a massive issue.

## Information
Your srcds console window will spam this message if it's currently being attacked.

IPADDRESS : PORT:reliable state invalid (0)..

This exploit may affect all source engine games.

## Installation
Just put the attached LagExploitFix_3_7_2020.txt file inside your csgo\addons\gamedata\ folder and install the smx in the plugins folder. Load the plugin manually with sm_rcon sm plugins load ServerLagExploitFix_3_7_2020 or restart your server for it to auto load.

## Clarification
This is an in-game engine denial of service attack. A client connects to your game server instance with a hack and forces the server to lag by spamming stuff you can't with a vanilla game client. This plugin removes those commands operations which are intensive via replacing the assembly instructions with nothing. (The description is vague to prevent easy recreation of the exploit which would cause a big surge in attacks)

## Warning
This plugin is written differently then most. It's just raw assembly instruciton replacement. This means it can easily break and lead to crashing after server updates. If you are using this plugin and your server starts crashing, start your debugging efforts by removing this plugin.

## Note to the "hackers" that keep attacking community servers I manage
I will keep figuring out the exploit you are abusing and create patchs which will be released publiclly. Please continue
